# Epicodus Track Suggester App

#### An exercise in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap; October 19th, 2018

#### By Paige Williams

## Description

  This is an app to help future students learn which Epicodus track is best for them. The app is set up like a survey, where the user enters their own information on what type of work they would like to do, and the app directs them to the best suited track based on their answers. The app uses JavaScript and jQuery to parse out their answers. It is then styled using Bootstrap, CSS and HTML.
